# Big-Data-Project
-
We want to get data from different source. Make a model and then visualize the final result.
The initial folder could be contains these:

+ data/             : Folder for datasets
+  code/            : Folder for PySpark scripts and notebooks
+ docs/             : Folder for documentation or presentation materials
+ results/          : Folder for generated outputs like graphs or reports
+ README.md         : Project overview and instructions
